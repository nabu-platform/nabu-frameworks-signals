Connection selection:

we ask the jdbc context for the framework within the running context, for instance:

running context is project1
framework is nabu.framework.logs

If we have hardcoded a context intercept on a jdbc connection somewhere, it will return that connection.
If there is no intercept, it will return the correct connection for the actual running context.

This gives us the ability to centralize the configuration or leave it per application.

Compare this to the original approach where we only asked the connection for the running context, which always ended up with project1. In this approach we could NOT create an intercept to centralize.
